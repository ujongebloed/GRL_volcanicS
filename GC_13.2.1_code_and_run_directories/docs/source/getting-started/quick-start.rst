Quick start

We invite you to watch our  `Getting Started with GEOS-Chem 13.0.0
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV4BIj8WAxE&t=5s>`_ video tutorial
(presented by GEOS-Chem Support Team member Melissa Sulprizio) for a
quick overview of how to download, compile, and run :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic`.

.. note:: Even though this video demonstrates how to get started using
	  the :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic 13.0.0` release, you can follow the
	  same steps for any subsequent GEOS-Chem version.

	  When this video was made, the GEOS-Chem
	  manual was located on the `GEOS-Chem wiki
	  <http://wiki.geos-chem.org>`_, and you will see references
	  being made to the wiki documentation.

	  We have since migrated much of the technical information for
	  :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` to this ReadTheDocs site. Scientific
	  documentation for GEOS-Chem may still be found on the GEOS-Chem wiki.
