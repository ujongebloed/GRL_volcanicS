.. _configure-your-computational-environment:

Configure your computational environment
========================================

In this chapter, we will show you how to create an **environment
file**.  An environment file does the following:

  1. Loads software libraries into your login environment.  This is
     often done with a module manager such as :command:`lmod`, :command:`spack`, or
     :command:`environment-modules`.

  2. Stores settings for GEOS-Chem and its dependent libraries in
     shell variables called `environment variables
     <https://www.networkworld.com/article/3215965/all-you-need-to-know-about-unix-environment-variables.html>`_.

Environment files allow you to easily switch between different sets of
libraries.  For example, you can keep one environment file to load the
Intel Compilers for GEOS-Chem and another to load the GNU Compilers.

For general information about how libraries are loaded, see our
:ref:`Library Guide <load-required-libraries-for-geos-chem>` in the
Supplement section.

.. _environment_files:

Environment files
-----------------

.. tip:: You may skip this section if you plan on using
	 :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` on an Amazon EC2 cloud instance,
         When you initialize the EC2 instance with one of the
	 pre-configured Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) all of the
	 required software libraries will be automatically loaded.

We recommend that you place module load commands into a separate
**environment file**  rather than directly into your :file:`~/.bashrc`
or :file:`~/.bash_aliases` startup scripts.

.. _gnu_10_example:

Sample environment file for GNU 10.2.0 compilers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a sample environment file from the Harvard Cannon computer
cluster.  This file will load software libraries built with the GNU 10.2.0
compilers.

Save the code below (with any appropriate modifications for your own
computer system) to a file named :file:`~/gcclassic.gnu102.env`.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Echo message if we are in a interactive (terminal) session
    if [[ $- = *i* ]] ; then
      echo "Loading modules for GEOS-Chem, please wait ..."
    fi

.. tip:: Ask your sysadmin how to load software libraries.  If you
         are using your institution's computer cluster, then chances
	 are there will be a software module system installed, with
	 commands similar to those listed above.

Then you can activate these seetings from the command line by typing:

.. code-block:: console

   $ source ~/gcclassic.gnu102.env

You may also place the :command:`source ~/gcclassic.gnu102.env` command
within your :ref:`GEOS-Chem run scripts <sample-geos-chem-run-scripts>`.

.. _intel_19_example:

Sample environment file for Intel 19 compilers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To load software libraries based on the Intel 19 compilers, we can
start from our :ref:`GNU 10.2.0 environment file <gnu_10_example>` and
add the proper :command:`module load` commands for Intel 19.

Add the code below (with the appropriate modifications for your
system) into a file named :file:`~/gcclassic.intel19.env`.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Echo message if we are in a interactive (terminal) session
    if [[ $- = *i* ]] ; then
      echo "Loading modules for GEOS-Chem, please wait ..."
    fi

         are using your institution's computer cluster, then chances
	 are there will be a software module system installed, with

   $ source gcclassic.intel19.env

You may also place the :command:`source ~/gcclassic.intel19.env` command
within your :ref:`GEOS-Chem run scripts <sample-geos-chem-run-scripts>`.

.. tip:: Keep a separate environment file for each combination of
	 modules that you will load.

.. _set_environment-variables-for-compilers:

Set environment variables for compilers
---------------------------------------

Use the following environment variables to specify compilers:

+---------------+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+
| Variable      | Specifies the:   | GNU name           | Intel name      |
+===============+==================+====================+=================+
| :envvar:`CC`  | C compiler       | :option:`gcc`      | :option:`icc`   |
+---------------+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+
| :envvar:`CXX` | C++ compiler     | :option:`g++`      | :option:`icpc`  |
+---------------+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+
| :envvar:`FC`  | Fortran compiler | :option:`gfortran` | :option:`ifort` |
+---------------+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+

These environment variables should be defined in your
:ref:`environment file <environment_files>`.

.. note:: Only the Fortran compiler is needed to compile :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic`.
	  But if you will be building other software packages (such as
	  :ref:`KPP-for-GEOS-Chem`), or :ref:`manually installing
          libraries  <build-libraries-for-geos-chem-with-spack>`,
          you will also need the C and C++ compilers.

.. _specifying-parallelization-settings:

Set environment variables for parallelization
---------------------------------------------

:program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` uses `OpenMP parallelization
<Parallelizing_GEOS-Chem>`_, which is an implementation of
shared-memory (aka serial) parallelization. Two environment variables
control the OpenMP parallelization settings, as defined below.

.. important:: OpenMP-parallelized programs (such as GEOS-Chem
	       Classic) cannot execute on more than 1 computational node.

	       Most modern computational nodes typically contain
	       between 16 and 64 cores. Therefore, :program:`GEOS-Chem
	       Classic` simulations will not be able to take
	       advantage of more cores than these.

	       We recommend that you consider using
	       `GCHP <https://gchp.readthedocs.io>`_ for more
	       computationally-intensive simulations.

.. _omp-num-threads:

OMP_NUM_THREADS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :envvar:`OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable sets the number of
computational cores (aka threads) that you would like GEOS-Chem
Classic to use.

For example, the command below will tell :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic`
to use 8 cores within parallel sections of code:

.. code:: console

    $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8

We recommend that you define :envvar:`OMP_NUM_THREADS` not only in your
environment file, but also in your :ref:`GEOS-Chem run scripts
<sample-geos-chem-run-scripts>`.

.. _omp-stacksize:

OMP_STACKSIZE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` with
`OpenMP parallelization <Parallelizing_GEOS-Chem>`_, you must
request the maximum amount of stack memory in your Unix environment.
(The stack memory is where local automatic variables and temporary
:envvar:`!$OMP PRIVATE` variables will be created.) Add the following lines to
your system startup file and to your GEOS-Chem run scripts:

.. code-block:: bash

   ulimit -s unlimited
   export OMP_STACKSIZE=500m

The :command:`ulimit -s unlimited` will tell the bash shell to use the
maximum amount of stack memory that is available.

The environment variable :envvar:`OMP_STACKSIZE` must also be set to a very
large number. In this example, we are nominally requesting 500 MB of
memory. But in practice, this will tell the GNU Fortran compiler to use
the maximum amount of stack memory available on your system. The value
**500m** is a good round number that is larger than the amount of stack
memory on most computer clusters, but you can increase this if you wish.

We recommend that you set :envvar:`OMP_STACKSIZE` not only in your Bash startup
script, but in also each :ref:`GEOS-Chem run script <Sample GEOS-Chem
run scripts>`  that you use.

.. _errors_caused_by_incorrect_settings:

Errors caused by incorrect variable settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be on the lookout for these errors:

  1. If :envvar:`OMP_NUM_THREADS` is set to 1, then your
     :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` simulation will execute using only one
     computational core.  This will make your simulation take much
     longer than is necessary.

  2. If :envvar:`OMP_STACKSIZE` environment variable is not included in your
     environment file (or if it is set to a very low value), you might
     encounter a segmentation fault
     `segmentation fault error after the TPCORE transport module is initialized <Segmentation_faults#Segmentation_fault_encountered_after_TPCORE_initialization>`_.
     In this case, :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic`  "thinks" that it does
     not have enough memory to perform the simulation, even though
     sufficient memory may be present.
