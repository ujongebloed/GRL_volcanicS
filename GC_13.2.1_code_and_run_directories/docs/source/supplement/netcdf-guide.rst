Using netCDF with GEOS-Chem
===========================

GEOS-Chem uses the `netCDF library
<https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`_ file format for data
I/O.  netCDF is the de-facto standard file format in use by Earth
system modeling applications.

Our documentation on netCDF is currently located on the `GEOS-Chem
wiki <http://wiki.geos-chem.org>`_.  We plan to migrate this
information to ReadTheDocs in the future.

For more information about netCDF, please see:

- `Introduction to netCDF <http://wiki.geos-chem.org/Introduction_to_netCDF>`_

- `The COARDS netCDF conventions for Earth Science data
  <http://wiki.geos-chem.org/The_COARDS_netCDF_conventions_for_earth_science_data>`_

- `Working with netCDF data files <http://wiki.geos-chem.org/Working_with_netCDF_data_files>`_

- `Creating netCDF data files for GEOS-Chem
  <http://wiki.geos-chem.org/Creating_netCDF_data_files_for_GEOS-Chem>`_

We also invite you to read our :ref:`documentation for building netCDF
with Spack <build-libraries-for-geos-chem-with-spack>`.
